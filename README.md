# Tahrirchi_Test_Task
I have done all the steps. About collecting more data like this, we should put as many links as possible into the txt file and send it to the code. So it returns the csv daatset. It is easy if the code is deployed as a telegram bot. 

And about the project "tahrirchi", we can do it with NLP. We will be using LSTM and GRU APIs to classify and predict the texts. I have some experience with NLP, so if there is needed data, I may train a model that gives suggestions and even correct the mistakes. Or we may even create chat bot in Uzbek Language. 

How it works is that every letter takes certain token with tokeniser API and puts the word into list. List is a vector. So the vector is located in the x,y system It takes the direction according to the list values. In that way every word is different and has different direction which can get different meanings. So it is how the computer understands words.
